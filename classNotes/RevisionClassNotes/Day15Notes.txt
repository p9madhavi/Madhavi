Unit testing:

 --  Address collection 
 		-- check if address got converetd. For example, in our case 5 out 7.
 		--- city counts and state count are correct
 File Example
 	 -- test if it read data correctly
  	-- test if written correctly

 KthLargestSmallest
 	-- tets if it found correct values

 MonthFinderByMap
 	-- 12 months two exceptions

NumberSearchApp
	--  test if it is searching properly
	  max min

personCollection
	-- check if correct persons are created

primeNumber app
    -- check if it is returning correct numbers

URLParserApp
 ---  chek for output



PrimeNumber
   --- it has two methods
   1. it checks if the number is a prime or not
        -- give a prime number then it should say that it is a prime number
        -- give 1 and check if it is saying it as prime
        --- give 2 and check if it si saying that it is prime
        -- give not a prime number and it should say not a prime number
   2. it prints all the prime numbers between 0 and the given number
        -- 1 -- only number
        --  2 it prints both 1 and 2
        -- 50  -- check if it prints all the primes


   KthLargestSmallest
 	 --- it has two methods
 	 1.it checks for the kthlargestNumber in the array
 	    ----give a kthnumber to check whether we are getting the correct number
 	    ----give 


 	MonthFinderByMap
 	    ----it has one method to check the month  --  findMonth
	 	    ----check the monthName for all the monthnumbers( 1 to 12);
	 	    ----give -2 to check if it is giving NotAValidmonthNumber exception or not
	 	    ---- give -56 to check if it is giving NotAValidmonthNumber exception or not  
	 	    -----give 18 to check if it is giving NotAValidmonthNumber exception or not 
	 	    -----give 100 to check if it is giving NotAValidmonthNumber exception or not
	 	    -----give anyString to check if it is giving NotEvenANumber exception or not 


I'm starting here
I'm trying to print value: null
I created a monthFinderByMap class
created 3 integers a=10 b=10 c=10
about to call findMonth
??
??
I'm in NotAValidMonthNumber catch block
created 3 integers a=5 b=5 c=5
Ending the program bye
