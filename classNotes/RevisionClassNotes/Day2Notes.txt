Notes::

--->Always import Classes And Not Packages;


---->Always Check The Method Signature and Send Appropriate Values Matching The Data Type;

----->If We have The Same Variable Name For A Method Variable And A Class Variable By Default It will Take Only Method Variable.
     If We Want to Access Class Variable Then WE Have to Use "this " Keyword.


Exercise:
  1. create FirstProgram with
       three variables int, boolean and long
       three methods
          one with no return type and no arguments and it will print all three variables
          second with no return type and am int argument. and it will add this to the int class variable
          third method with long return type and long argument. and it will return the sum of the argument and class long variable

  2. Demo the firstProgram in FirstProgram app   
  
     int ainteger = 5;
     long aLong = 10;
