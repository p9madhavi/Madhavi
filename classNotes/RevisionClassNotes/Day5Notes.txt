You have entered 18 which is an incorrect number

Why we need exceptions
  -- without exceptions we need to write if else statements in main program
      but some times even if we write if else we may miss some valid cases
         like if result of division is zero.

1. you have to create CannotDivideTheNumbersException
   update the calculatorApp

2. create a NotAValdiMonthNumberException and update
     findMonth FindSeasonBySwitch and findSeasonByIf methods 
     MonthFInderApp
