build management systems
  Maven,Ant, Graddle, Ivy, puppet..


 why build management
    to makes things easier especially things that we do repeated


Maven  --- how to use it.
  we have to tell it.  Configuration file.. csv, yaml, xml, json

  xml file format.  --- pom.xml
  pom ---Project Object Model..


  directory structure have to followed.

  src
     main  --java
             resources
     test  -- java
             resources

 ----->   STANDARD PROJECT STRUCTURE         

    my-app
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   `-- java
    |       `-- com
    |           `-- mycompany
    |               `-- app
    |                   `-- App.java
    `-- test
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- mycompany
                    `-- app
                        `-- AppTest.java 

 The src/main/java directory contains the project source code, 
 the src/test/java directory contains the test source, 
 the pom.xml file is the project's Project Object Model, or POM. 

 POM -------> Project Object Model..
    The pom.xml file is the core of a project's configuration in Maven. It is a single configuration file that contains the majority of information required to build a project in just the way you want. The POM is huge and can be daunting in its complexity, but it is not necessary to understand all of the intricacies just yet to use it effectively.                              


main tag is <build>
     we will tell what we want
        plugins --- the tools/programs 

1. compile -- compiler          compiler   ---> target compile
2. run      -- exec plugin      exec      ----> target java


jar ---  java archives
war  --- web archives
ear ---  enterprise archives
