   Integration


System is a complicated components/modules . [group of classes in java ,group of tables in Database, like that ]      
Multiple systems --- integration testing

---->Testing framework
   		BDD framework [Behaviour Driven Developement]

Cucumber is BDD test framework
    behaviour explaining tests --- Gherkins language
     ---> code tie up and run the code   


---->>  Advantages of Cucumber Over Other Tools
 a) Cucumber supports different languages like Java.net and Ruby.
 b) It acts as a bridge between the business and technical language. We can accomplish
this by creating a test case in plain English text.
c) It allows the test script to be written without knowledge of any code, it allows the
involvement of non-programmers as well.
d) It serves the purpose of end-to-end test framework unlike other tools.
e) Due to simple test script architecture, Cucumber provides code reusability.

Feature   


Important FrameWork Methods::::::::::::::::::

   Assert.assertEquals(sum.intValue(),result.intValue());  ------>Calculator Addition and result is equal to addition

 Assert.assertTrue(false);   |
  Assert.assertTrue(true);   |--------> used in the Cucumber FrameWork

   Assert.assertEquals(monthName, "February");   -----> TestNG

 -------->>>>  AddressCollection
       test cases

       positive:::

       1.populate the data

         provide valiid string data
            create class
            pass test data to the constructor
            call populate data
            check total of addresses


            if the address format is wrong ,it should not display the address
          provide invalid string data
             create class
             pass test data

       2.printing the addresses
       3.count the states
       4.count the cities

       when we enter the incorrect username and pass



       User is already on login page
           enter userrname
           enterpas
           click submit
          observe the error msg



Feature: parse data

  Senario: valid data need to be converetd to address
  	Given a AddressCollection class
  	And valid string "sam,125 davis cary,NC" is provided
  	Then the ttotal count should be 0


Feature counts

   Scenario count city
   	Given a AddressColel class
   	And valid string "sam,125 davis dr,cary,NC" is provided
   	Then the city "cary" count should be 1

   	@Give()
   	{
   	    dummy method 
   	}
   	@And  {string}
   	   String validData
   	{ 

   		List<String> addreeses = new Array...<>()
   		adde.add(validData)
   	addres =  new addre(addresss)}

   	@Then  {string} count should be {int}
       (String city, int extpected count )
   	}
   	{
   		addCocll.populate
   		assertEquals addCollec.getCityCount(city), expectedCount
   	}
